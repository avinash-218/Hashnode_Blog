## A**utomating Instance Stoppage**

AWS EC2 instances are billed based on their running time, so it's essential to optimize their usage to control costs effectively. One way to achieve this is by automating the stoppage of your AWS EC2 instance when it becomes idle based on specific constraints. In this section, we'll show you how to set up an automatic stoppage mechanism to ensure your instance stops when it's not actively used.

##### **Step 1: Create an Alarm**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console and navigate to the "Instances" page.
    
2. Select the instance for which you want to set up the automatic stoppage.
    
3. Click on the "Monitoring" tab and choose "Create Alarm."
    
4. In the "Create Alarm" wizard, configure the alarm based on the condition that defines when the instance is considered idle. For example, you can set the condition as "CPUUtilization &lt;= 10% for 3 consecutive periods of 5 minutes."
    
5. For the alarm action, choose "Stop" so that the instance will stop when the condition is met.
    
6. Review and create the alarm.
    

##### **Step 2: Preventing Unwanted Stoppage**

1. Once the alarm is created, the instance will transition from "OK" to "Alarm" state when the specified condition is met. The automatic stop action will then be triggered.
    
2. However, to prevent unwanted automatic stoppage, turn off the action of the alarm when you need to work on the instance. This can be achieved by disabling the alarm action through the Amazon CloudWatch console.
    

##### **Step 3: Using Tmux for Background Processing (Optional)**

1. To continue running background processes on the instance, even after detaching from the terminal, you can use Tmux as described in the "Tmux: Terminal Multiplexer" section of this blog. Tmux allows processes to run independently in the background, even when the terminal session is detached.
    
2. With Tmux, you can detach from the EC2 instance while your background processes continue running. You can later reconnect to the instance and reattach to the Tmux session to check the status of your processes.
    

By automating the stoppage of your AWS EC2 instance when it becomes idle, you can efficiently manage costs and ensure that your resources are utilized optimally.
